Can we reverse a linked list in less than O(n)?

Its not possible to reverse singly linked list in less than o(n) time in recursive and iterative both 
the cases

why QuickSort preffered for arrays and mergeSort for linkedList ?

because mergeSort required extraa space for merging two array so its space complexity in case of array is
O(n) , but in case of linked list it not create new list using their links arrange the list as a sorted
order , so its not required any extraa space , space complexity O(1)  so that why mergeSort preffered for
sorting linkedList

QuickSort their time complexity in average case is O(nlog)  and it not uses any extraa space while sort
the array , so its preffered for sorting array
